# Notes

For the first part of this exercise, I followed this tutorial to fetch quotes from the json source and display the quotes in a list: [Up and Running with Backbone.js](http://www.lynda.com/Backbonejs-tutorials/Up-Running-Backbonejs/163089-2.html)

For the second part of this exercise, I took a slightly different approach and followed the source code for the client-side demo of the backbone.paginator, to create a pageable backbone collection: [Backbone Paginator](http://backbone-paginator.github.io/backbone.paginator/examples/client-mode.html)

As such, I have two different html files for the two different parts of the exercise. "quotes.html" is for the first part, and "paginated_quotes.html" is for the second part.
